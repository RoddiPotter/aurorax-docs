# Conjunction Search

The AuroraX Conjunction Search engine is a tool for finding conjunctions between ground-based ASIs and space-based instruments. It helps researchers streamline the process of "event discovery", quickly narrowing down the possible times that may contain interesting data.

The Conjunction Search is available in several different forms:

* On the AuroraX website using [dropdown menus](https://aurorax.space/conjunctionSearch/dropdowns)
* On the AuroraX website using [free-form](https://aurorax.space/conjunctionSearch/freeform) JSON
* [PyAuroraX](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/overview/), a Python 3.6+ library designed to interact with the AuroraX API
* Directly using the [AuroraX REST API](https://api.aurorax.space/)
