# Basics - Introduction

Four of PyAuroraX's modules contain most of the functionality that a regular user will need:

* [`sources`](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/api_reference/pyaurorax/sources.html) 
    
    Contains the `DataSource` class as well as functions for searching, retrieving, creating, and updating data sources in the AuroraX database. Searching and retrieving are covered in the [data sources basic usage](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/basic_usage/data_sources/) section. Creating and updating is covered in the advanced usage section on [creating and managing data](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/advanced_usage/contributing_managing_data/#data-sources).

* [`ephemeris`](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/api_reference/pyaurorax/ephemeris.html) 
    
    Contains the `Ephemeris` class as well as functions for searching, creating, and updating ephemeris records in the AuroraX database. Searching is covered in the [ephemeris basic usage](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/basic_usage/ephemeris/) section. Creating and updating is covered in the advanced usage section on [creating and managing data](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/advanced_usage/contributing_managing_data/#ephemeris-records).

* [`data_products`](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/api_reference/pyaurorax/data_products.html) 
    
    Contains the `DataProduct` class as well as functions for searching, creating, and updating data product records in the AuroraX database. Searching is covered in the [data products basic usage](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/basic_usage/data_products/) section. Creating and updating is covered in the advanced usage section on [creating and managing data](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/advanced_usage/contributing_managing_data/#data-product-records).

* [`conjunctions`](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/api_reference/pyaurorax/conjunctions.html) 
    
    Contains the `Conjunction` class as well as functions for searching for conjunctions between ephemeris records in the AuroraX database. Searching is covered in the [conjunctions basic usage](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/basic_usage/conjunctions/) section. More complex conjunction queries are covered in the [advanced conjunction searches](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/advanced_usage/advanced_conjunctions/) section.


The following pages will describe some of the most common uses of these modules.
