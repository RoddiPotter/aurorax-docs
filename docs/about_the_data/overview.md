# About AuroraX Data

The AuroraX platform contains a significant amount of data, in various formats and specifications. Below, we give a brief introduction to the main categories, and in the other pages in this section we go into some more depth on different aspects of the data.

## Introduction

AuroraX currently has metadata derived from several ground-based ASI arrays, satellites, and satellite instruments in its database. The database contains two [data categories](/about_the_data/categories): 

1. [ephemeris](/about_the_data/categories#ephemeris) records which provide location and operational information for a given ground/space instrument
2. metadata about [data products](/about_the_data/categories#data-products) such as keograms or other summary plots (no data product images are stored, URLs are used as unique identifiers).

We are  working hard to add more and the below list will be updated as any new metdata are integrated. If you're interested in getting your additional metadata into the system, please reach out to <a href='&#109;ailt&#111;&#58;edono%76&#97;&#37;6E%40uc%&#54;1lg%6&#49;%7&#50;y&#46;&#99;a'>Eric Donovan</a> and/or <a href='mail&#116;o&#58;%6&#52;%63ha%&#54;4%&#54;4o&#99;&#64;u&#99;%61lg&#97;ry&#46;%&#54;3a'>Darren Chaddock</a>.
