# Data Availability

The Data Availability page on the AuroraX website provides an easy and quick way to see what data is in the database. You can visit the page [here](https://aurorax.space/data/availability).

Furthermore, there is a [Data Information](https://aurorax.space/data/information) page that provides additional statistics about data in the AuroraX database.

## Getting availability programmatically

The availability information is also available using PyAuroraX or the API directly:

* [PyAuroraX data availability functions](/python_libraries/pyaurorax/advanced_usage/availability_and_stats)
* [API data availability REST endpoints](/api/../../api/advanced_usage/availability_and_stats)
