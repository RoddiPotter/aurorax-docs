# Data Policy

Since AuroraX is a global repository of metadata describing the world's auroral imaging data, our data policy is one focussed towards openness and accurate ownerhsip. The following are the rules we adhere to:

* AuroraX does not consider itself the "owner" of any data in the database. It is merely a data aggregation system to allow for faster discovery of distributed auroral datasets.
* All data in AuroraX is metadata and/or summary data. Raw data should be retrieved using each data providers custom websites.
* AuroraX does not need to house any summary data on its servers, though this is beneficial for web/API/toolkit performance.
