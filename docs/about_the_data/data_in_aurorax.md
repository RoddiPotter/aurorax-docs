# What Data Is In AuroraX?

AuroraX currently has data from several ground-based ASI arrays, satellites, and satellite instruments. We are currently working hard to add more data and the below list will be updated as any new datasets are integrated. If you're interested in getting your data into the system, please reach out to <a href='&#109;ailt&#111;&#58;edono%76&#97;&#37;6E%40uc%&#54;1lg%6&#49;%7&#50;y&#46;&#99;a'>Eric Donovan</a> and/or <a href='mail&#116;o&#58;%6&#52;%63ha%&#54;4%&#54;4o&#99;&#64;u&#99;%61lg&#97;ry&#46;%&#54;3a'>Darren Chaddock</a>.

More information about the data in AuroraX can be found on our main website <a href="https://aurorax.space/data/about" target="_blank">here</a>.
