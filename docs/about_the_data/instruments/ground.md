# Ground-based Instruments

The only ground-based instrument currently in AuroraX are All Sky Imagers (ASIs). More will follow as we add more datasets to AuroraX.

## All Sky Imagers

All Sky Imagers are cameras that collect images of auroral phenomenon using a wide-angle fisheye lens. The "all sky" aspect is what differentiates them from other types of auroral data since they capture horizon-to-horizon images.

### Examples of data

### Keograms

Keograms are images that represent a period of time of data from an ASI. The centre column of each frame is extracted and stacked left-to-right to form the keogram. North is at the top, south at the bottom, and time runs from left-to-right.

Below is one example of keograms with several stacked vertically. The top frames are all from a certain time identified by the red lines, each image is from a different ASI (left to right and top to bottom: TREx Blueline, TREx NIR, TREx RGB, REGO).
