# Data Availability and Statistics

Since AuroraX has a lot of data in its database, it's important to be able to quickly identify what periods of time have data from certain data sources. To do this, we have developed two interfaces that provide this kind of information: 1) data availability, and 2) data statistics. Below, we'll have a look at both briefly.

Note that Swarm-Aurora also has this [quick-look availability interface](https://swarm-aurora.com/availability/){:target="_blank"}.

## Availability

The data availability information for AuroraX is visualized using the [Data Availability webpage](https://aurorax.space/data/availability){:target="_blank"}. Below is a screenshot of it. You can look at availability information for ephemeris or data products records, filtering by program if desired. The interface visualizes one year of data at a time.

## Statistics

The data statistics information for AuroraX is shown in a table with columns for record counts and earliest/latest timestamps of records.

You can view the page [here](https://aurorax.space/data/statistics){:target="_blank"}.

## Next step

Lastly, we'll have a look into ways of interacting with AuroraX programmatically. Such as the API and the Python library called PyAuroraX.
