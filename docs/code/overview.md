# Developer Zone

AuroraX tools are built on top of a set of APIs, so using the platform programmatically is very easily supported. We have several tools available for this purpose, with more in development. 

## Programmatic methods

There are four main ways of interacting with AuroraX programmatically:

1. Making raw HTTP/HTTPS requests to the RESTful APIs
2. Writing Python code with [PyAuroraX](https://github.com/aurorax-space/pyaurorax){:target="_blank"}
3. Using the command line with aurorax-cli (part of PyAuroraX)
4. Writing IDL code with idl-aurorax library (we're working on it, coming soon)

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to use the Python library [PyAuroraX](https://github.com/aurorax-space/pyaurorax){:target="_blank"}. You can also interact with the API directly, using HTTPS-based RESTful requests (GET, POST, etc.) in any programming language.
