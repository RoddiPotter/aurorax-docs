# Upgrading

PyAuroraX and IDL-AuroraX libraries require developers to do a few steps to upgrade already-installed packages to the latest version. Below, we'll go over those steps. You can also find this information on the README pages for each respective code repository on Github.

## PyAuroraX

You can upgrade PyAuroraX using pip:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pyaurorax
```

More details can be found on the readme of the code repository [on Github](https://github.com/aurorax-space/pyaurorax){:target="_blank"}.

## IDL-AuroraX

You can upgrade IDL-AuroraX using the `ipm` command:

```idl
IDL> ipm,/update,'idl-aurorax'
```
