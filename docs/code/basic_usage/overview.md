# The Basics

There are a few main categories of functions in the AuroraX programmatic tools:

- [Interacting with data sources](/code/basic_usage/data_sources/)
- [Performing conjunction searches](/code/basic_usage/conjunctions/)
- [Performing ephemeris searches](/code/basic_usage/ephemeris/)
- [Performing data product searches](/code/basic_usage/data_products/)
- [Retrieving data availability and statistics information](/code/advanced_usage/availability_and_stats/)
- [Uploading ephemeris and data product data](/code/advanced_usage/contributing_data/)

## What functions can we do

Below is a list of the different functions that are available to do programmatically.

- Data Sources
    - [retrieve data source information](/code/basic_usage/data_sources/)
    - [create and update data sources (advanced)](/code/advanced_usage/contributing_data/)
- Conjunction, ephemeris, and data product searching
    - [search for conjunctions](/code/basic_usage/conjunctions/)
    - [search for ephemeris data](/code/basic_usage/ephemeris/)
    - [search for data product data](/code/basic_usage/data_products/)
    - [retrieve information about a search request ID](/code/advanced_usage/asynchronous_search/)
- Managing data
    - [upload ephemeris metadata (advanced)](/code/advanced_usage/contributing_data/)
    - [upload data product metadata (advanced)](/code/advanced_usage/contributing_data/)

## Next steps

The rest of the pages in this "Basic Usage" section have detailed examples of each of these tasks. The examples include the code for doing each in a variety of ways (ie. Python, IDL, Javascript, command line).
